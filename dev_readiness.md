# developer readiness

----

## problem at hand

 * am having constant struggle to have my personal machine up and ready for any programming task at the spur of the moment

## the thought / idea

 * have standardized procedure to have the machine always ready for / with 
  * one of the in-mem db like H2 or HSQL or mysql etc 
  * IDE: be it eclipse flavor, PyCharm, Visual Studio, with its latest updates
  * SQL-client tool; either one per db or universal, squirrel
  * API testing tool: bruno
 * have one VM for developer tools, one VM for DB, one VM for application deployments
 * practise docker
 * practise mini-kube
 * have build tools ready: git, gradle, python setups, etc.
 * sonarqube setup and usage is needed
 * CI/CD like jenkins is also needed
 * next up from this is programming "good-parts" like SOLID principles and such
 * next up is coding katas
