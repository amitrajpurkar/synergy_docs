###asking for employment letter..###
```
Hi Malcolm,

Getting in touch with you after a long time. Believe all is going good on your side. 
I wanted to get an Employment letter for the period i was with Axe (March 2008 till Nov 2011). I am located in Florida, USA these days working as a consultant in an Insurance company here. I am preparing my application for GC processing and hence i needed employment letters of all previous employers.


Can you please let me know whom i should get in touch with from Axe Group and i will also try to find from my folks if a particular format is needed for the US Consulate.


With Warm Regards,
-Amit
