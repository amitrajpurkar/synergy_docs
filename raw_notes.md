python for dhanesh..
please please follow these basic guideline (no mater what programming language you use)
* modularize your code... break it down into modules -- in python this is a function.
* each exercise in your packet, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc, must be in its own function -- no ifs and buts about it
* i know your "teacher has not taught it officially" -- that is not an excuse. You are expected to read and research forward in each and every subject ... especially as you are an IB-student in a college preparatory school.. 
* so please get into that habit of modularizing code into respective short functions
* inside each function, first set a multi-line comment and paste there the entire question.. along with edge case..
* one example of edge case -- in 1.1 it has been asked that assume screen width is 40 columns and then wrap the output... so make sure you include that scenario and show how the wrapping works
* execute each function one by one towards the very end of the script file. so that from the start of the file you are defining each function and placing your solution in each, the respective multi-line comment in each.. and towards the end execute each fuction (meaning each exercise, one by one)
* this is how you are expected to solve your packet.... never ever write a continuos chain of commands -- you will never understand programming if you do that..
* the essential starter steps in the learning process is to modularize the program into individual modules (which are the functions)... always break one large problem into smaller chunks and solve each smaller chunk... (this applies to any problem in file)



* Dhanesh normal GPA=3.56; weighted GPA=4.5

Friday meeting with Web/Mobile team about consuming EBSE services for benefits and accumulators
background:: in the current scenario, with EB Mainframe and MWS, the mobile channel has been consuming similar services that provide them the final text messages that are being used to paint the device screen directly without any processing. -- secondly mobile channel is currently only supporting english
problem:: with the design of the EBSE services, the Mobile channel will now receive message-tokens which they will need to process/ decode from message-bundles (resource-bundles) and then use them on device screen.
the rationale for the design was to make possible both English and Spanish response easier and uniform across channels

at the moment, the mobile team does not have the plan/time-resource to develop additional code for this change..
.. they were anticipating similar response from the EBSE service as the current MWS
so if they wish to maintain the same mechanism as today, they will need additional service between EBSE and them that will help do that translation -- this defeats the purpose of enterprise service
.. another option possible is to have text-message and web-message elements from the respective responses of EBSE Services as the source of truth and only use the message-keys when they need to selectively change text to smaller description or alternate version -- this can help reduce the code changes on mobile team size
.. another point being raised is that multiple teams need not maintain message-bundles for english and spanish text -- rather EBSE takes up the ownership of these message-bundles from MWS and also maintains the process to handle Spanish translation (which will include arranging the translation and spanish testing)
one possible option seen for spanish reponse is to load the spanish message-bundle in mongo so that EBSE services can serve both English and Spanish based on a new header parameter "locale"

rental property tips from Ajit
check the ages of the family members who want to rent
why are there two centre link incomes
are they elderly couple with nanny?
how many children are tehre in that household..
Does anyone smoke in the house -- smoking smell sticks to carpet/ hosiery, etc..
will the rent be paid by them or by the dpt of housing?
will the rental agreement be made with department of housing commision?
we can get more results from aussie craig-list equivalent.. gumtree
we can give contact refrences of ajit or even bhai sahab and verify how the people are and then route them to debbie for making agreement.

 * All prepared for phase 2 go live ?? any items pending?
 * Feature code of-course ß we are all good here..
 * Logging
 ** Analytical logs in splunk… are we 100% ?
 ** Payloads in EAS… are we 100% ?
 ** Debugs, stacktrace in kibana… are we 100% ?
 * Error handling… are we 100% ?
 ** Handled exceptions with EBSE error codes..
 ** Unhandled exceptions caught in “after throwing advice” … are we 100% ?
 * Parallel processing.. any improvements needed ??
 * Wait-periods at socket connections, timeouts via hystrix… any improvements needed ??
 * what do u all feel are the areas of improvements in code that are must have???
 * what is it that u all feel we miss or need in place to make our code stand out for a long time

reflecting on the past
 * what we have achieved so far..
 ** it has been an amazing piece of work.. hats off to you all developers..
 ** you all have proved to be super heros of our project.. avengers indeed
 ** i do acknowledge all your hard work and dedication..
 ** our EBSE application indeed stands on the shoulders of Super Heros.. in Developers, Analysts as well as QA .. all of them
 ** Note:: the world should not be running on the powers of Super Heros.. it should be run be ordinary perople working 9-5
 ** Note:: it is not sustainable to continue being Super Hero.. we cannot do this for long..
 ** i am not able to document if it is the volume of activities pending that is killing us
 ** or is it the complexity in application that is killing us..
 ** we need to think on this later.. let us see what can be done immediately or right after go-live..

For upcoming phases… What is pending..
 * Feature code as usual for next phase
 * Breaking down complex code files.. and complex methods..
 * Testability .. code coverage/ unit test, integration tests if possible
 * Taking off logging from EBSE.. possibly moving into separate app, eb-logger.. to reduce processing load from EBSE..
 * Fluent D logging discussions..
 * Establishing direction for EAS logging vs alternatives…
 * Taking off logging into separate app ..
 ** to improve EBSE performance/speed
 ** as well as to address EAS needs of leadership
 * Possibly a separate app to cover regression tests for ebse on the whole (more visible bdd style regression adhering 5010 standard)
 * Code clean ups

shelf-life of ebse code../ from the email to robb..
 * Code cleanups and long pending improvements – it needs time.. we should not push this out –
 ** it will adversely impact shelf-life of EBSE
 ** (I would like to see our application, which takes over mainframe running this for 35 years.. to atleast work for 40/50 plus years)
 ** The application should not need a re-write in 2/ 3 years.. defining shelf-life will help clarify this need
 * Without making code improvements – like reducing complexity.. increasing testability, etc.,.
 ** will make it increasingly harder to maintain the application..
 ** it will also make it harder for any new developer to understand and pickup our code.
 ** question is.. can EBSE remain good and running if Amit is taken off.. if not what else is needed
 ** next question will be .. can we hand over code to the-next-developer and have EBSE run good
 * Another one, is a wishful need from my side.. automated-regression module/suite for EBSE.. this is another item that will help EBSE survive long life
 ** what i can see is without automated regression, and a visible suite/ module like BDD/ Serenity, etc. it will be hard to take off nidhin/ sirisha
 ** question is can we take off QA team from EBSE?? i strongly feel no.. we need both test-coverage, plus automated-regression
 ** next question.. can we take off our analysts from EBSE

What can be achieved in phase 3
 * ???? to be discussed


I still see the need of three developers (of-course without me J)
We should check the option of getting Venkat, if Renu is needed with PMT..

Besides feature code of phase 3 .. (which may appear small)
We have lots to achieve …
 * Taking off logging into separate app ..
 ** to improve EBSE performance/speed
 ** as well as to address EAS needs of leadership
 * Code cleanups and long pending improvements – it needs time.. we should not push this out –
 ** it will adversely impact shelf-life of EBSE
 ** (I would like to see our application, which takes over mainframe running this for 35 years.. to atleast work for 40 plus years)
 ** The application should not need a re-write in 2/ 3 years.. defining shelf-life will help clarify this need
 * Without making code improvements – like reducing complexity.. increasing testability, etc.,.
 ** will make it increasingly harder to maintain the application..
 ** it will also make it harder for any new developer to understand and pickup our code.
 * Another one, is a wishful need from my side.. automated-regression module/suite for EBSE.. this is another item that will help EBSE survive long life


As we can see… we do have need for 3 full time developers.

Hello Amit,


Thank you for your interest in the online Master of Computer Science program at Arizona State University.
My name is Anysia, and I am an Enrollment Coach; I work specifically with the Master of Computer Science program helping students through the application and admissions process.
As you move through these processes, please know I am here as your point of contact.
Let me know what questions you may have. I am in my office today until 5pm MST.


Thank you,
-Anysia

Hello Anysia,

I would first like to give you a short background. I have completed my Bachelors in Engineering (1995) and Masters in Business Administration (1998) from Universities in India. I have been working as a Software consultant since 1998. After working in several roles, software developer, systems analyst, quality analyst, tech lead, project manager, i am now working as an Architect/ Developer in Florida. I am working here on a "work-permit-visa", (have validity till May end 2020). By now i have about 20 years of experience working in Information Technology. Even though i have solid work experience and expertise in my field, I often get faced with questions about by education background as i have a Civil Engineering degree and Masters in Business Administration -- both of which are not so related to software development. Also at the moment in coming months i have a little leeway to find time and add one more degree to my list.

This is the reason why i am looking for pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science. As i am working full time in my current company as a contractor, i am also looking for a distance learning or online program. I wish to have minimum possible campus trips to the university where i will pursue this degree -- as it will be hard to get time off in my current job. Another note in my case is how much time i will be devoting to my course -- besides my lengthy hours at work, i am also a family man, so i can only start studies after both my boys go to bed by 10 pm EST. Between this and 5am next morning, will be my window when i will need to study or work on my degree-course.

Now the questions i have while choosing my college/ program...
* first question is do i qualify for applying to this course? i do have Bachelors and Masters degree; they are not recent and have been done overseas.
* i do have education evaluation done recently for my work visa purpose, which i can provide. Will it help? i also have transcripts for my degree courses, both Bachelors and Masters degree.
* do i need to take TOEFEL or IELTS exams for doing the application? i have been working in USA/ Australia for several years now.
* do i need to take GRE exam or any pre-qualifying or pre-requiste exam or course before i can apply to the masters degree?
* if i purse masters degree with ASU, will i need to make campus visits during the semesters? and if yes how many? or does it allow me a 100% online opportunity?
* For this masters degree, how many subjects will be there in total? and how many do i need to pursue in each semester? is it at my discretion alone? or do i need to do for example atleast 2 or 3 subjects per semester?
* how much is cost per semester or subject for this course and how does the fee structure work?
* is there any possibility that i can apply for scholarships or waiver schemes?
* does my job work which is in software development, contribute in any way towards the course too?


I am keeping my wife (Prajakta) in cc as she helps me arrange the finance.

Reference Letter Sample From a Manager #1

Recommendation for Michele Moody

I have worked very closely with Ms. Moody during the several years that she has served as an assistant in my office. Michele has excelled in this role, exhibiting one of the highest levels of productivity I have seen in an assistant during my 20-year tenure with the company. Michele produces a high volume of work while consistently maintaining high standards for quality and accuracy.

Michelle possesses the ultimate "can do" attitude while taking on all tasks with a positive energy and a smile. Her upbeat personality and engaging personal style enable her to interact effectively with clients and staff. She is very well organized and keeps track of the details necessary to coordinate events of this kind and run an efficient office.

Proactive in anticipating rising administrative needs, she takes initiative to go beyond the expected parameters of her job.


All the intangibles that lead to success in the workplace are in order with Michele. There will be no unpleasant surprises and I am confident she will fit in and add to office morale.

I volunteered to write this recommendation for Michele because I am very grateful for her contributions to our office and very confident that she has the intelligence, work ethic, and communications skills to add value wherever she works.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this outstanding young woman.

Sincerely,

FirstName LastName

Sample Reference Letter from Manager #2

I have known John Smith for the past year while he has worked as an Accounting Assistant in the Company Accounting Office. I have been consistently impressed by both John's attitude towards his work and his performance on the job.

His interpersonal and communication skills have allowed him to develop productive working relationships with both our clients and our staff. John has the listening and interviewing skills necessary to extract information from our clientele while performing financial assessments.

John possesses solid writing skills which have enabled him to compose quality correspondence. He also has the analytical skills to diagnose problems and devise viable solutions. His ability to remain unflustered during frenzied periods like tax season proves his ability to work well under pressure.

I recommend him for employment without reservation. Please let me know if you need further information.

In addition to his professional qualifications, Amit has personal qualities that make him well-suited to leadership. He’s naturally fallen into the role of “point person” that many of us go to with questions. He’s not afraid to take risks and often suggests new directions to explore. Amit was instrumental in introducing technology components. He’s committed to quality, growth, and progress.He inspires his team members to strive for the same. In short, Amit is a person with vision.

sellpoint notes..
enhancement needed to the process that calls siebel procedure update-quote
the health plan node has all desired attributes, pmt id, std var, gs var, plan-dfnn-id
the pharmacy plan node needs the similar attributes.. they are missing in current/ upcoming state (test env)
these changes will cover SG new sales, SG renewals, LG std new sales, LG std renewals, LG custom renewals
we need to still evaluate future state LG non std new sales/ renewals..
we also need to evaluate future state on grand-fathered/mothered plans (new sales/ renewals)

erate notes..
erate persists its own product data store.. these are loaded annually from pmt matrix
it does not have PMT ID for every/ each plan.. it does not have an field for std var, gs var.
erate will also mannually upload any new / updates to plans as per BRS received for such change
above is also based on PMT matrix
erate and siebel was two transactions.. siebel to erate = AddRenewal, erate to siebel = erate_msg
both these WSDL should ideally be enhanced to add desired PMT fields


Yes saw the grades the problem was due to no correct due dates and short weeks sir. I was not able to submit the final exam 2 fully as after 20th question the exam automatically submitted. Also for discussions I have posted the replies long back sir can u please recheck as u graded 50 percent for both discussion with comment as no responses.

Please also give me one more chance to submit the final paper as well sir because at least I will pass in the course. 

Please sir give me last chance to submit the above mentioned assignments and I’ll be grateful to you for my entire life sir. Grades are very important for me at this point as they are tied up with my h1 query aswell. Please sir, I didnt want to end up failing course and face the status issues sir.

hey a quick observation.. during the standups, u typically tend to ask "what are u working on?" it often sounds unwelcoming... (more like, r u doing any work? also, as if u r fully unaware of whats going on/ or dont have good handle on things.. this may put off the other person)  .. a better style can be "what are the updates from your side?" .. this conveys, we know that u are contributing / working, what are the key points that you would like to tell us, or any status. if the person is already having loads of items being worked, good question can be "what are the key or important updates from your side?" .. that way we are asking him not to tell us about each task but only the important ones that need attention... it just came to my mind, thought should let u know..

here is one write-up.. just in case it can help save some of us:
each of the team members are not just having depth of knowledge, technical expertise; but they have been exceptional team players, and have been delivering results with best "quality of service" seen. It will be next to impossible to get a replacement resource who can go those extra miles to make their teams successful. moreover each of us have often billed for a flat 40 hour week consistently while producing work output worth more and also actively participating in operations support outside office hours. For EBSE: this is a tier 1 application; the developers (each of the three) play a vital role not just in maintaining the application with highest quality standards, but also actively participating in production support. each of the team member has consistently performed above and beyond their job roles. This tier one application has been a benchmark not just for software quality but also its controls and alerts that have been beneficial to ITCC, Gateway team, and many others in the organization. ever since its inception, EBSE team members have outperformed on QoS, the depth of knowledge, continuous improvements, and ever helping attitude.

Hi Elena,
Here are the answers...1. I believe there is no "non-compete agreement" with my current company "Synergy Technologies Inc". 2. I am working on an "E3" visa which is a special category of Visas for Australian Citizens. My current E3 Visa expires on Feb 28th 2022. 2a. more information on E3 visa can be seen at "https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-3-specialty-occupation-workers-from-australia"3. This does not apply.. E3 visa is granted for a two year duration; and there is no limit on how many times you can renew. So there is no six-year rule like H1B visa4. Not applicable5. For GC processing, my i-140 is available and "Priority Date" is Sep 18th 20176. I am working for the same employer, Synergy, who sponsored my visa; I am working at client location for "Florida Blue" (also known as BCBS Florida) since Oct 2016. 7. not applicable. 
At the moment, I have a Visa valid till Feb 2022 and also have projects which are planned for next three years. But at Florida Blue the HR Department has received mandatory policy updates not to keep Contractors on Visa (foreign nationals) for more than three years tenures. Because of this HR department is not ready to extend my contract beyond 31st Dec. 
On other hand due to pandemic and other factors, USCIS offices are not fully operational. For changing employer, with my Visa category, i will have to leave the country, have visa interview at consulate office outside country and then only return back to US to work for new employer. Earliest interview dates at Mexico consulates are around mind November. 
Do let me know if Citizens Bank can look forward to sponsoring my E3 visa for the Full time role.Do also let me know if i need to wait in the current situation and try again once USCIS offices are fully operational
With Warm Regards,-Amit

ASO / Administrative Services Only = An arrangement in which an employer hires a third party to deliver administrative services to the employer such as claims processing and billing; the employer bears the risk for claims 

MPP / Minimum Premium Plan = A plan where the employer and the insurer agree that the employer will be responsible for paying all claims up to an agreed-upon aggregate level, with the insurer responsible for the excess. The insurer usually is also responsible for processing claims and administrative services

Payer to Payer Inter-Operability Mandate: CMS has released Inter-Operability mandate for insurance companies; for 2021-2022 the mandates for Patient Access and Payer to Payer Inter-Operability had to be implemented. I was involved in supporting senior Enterprise Architect in designing the interactions between internal and external systems for Payer to Payer inbound transactions. Insurance member moving from previous insurance company to Florida Blue can now give consent to Florida Blue to get his clinical data history from previous Insurance companies

Availity Optimization project: in this project I was assigned to develop a design for enhancing and enriching the current state X12 270-271 HIPAA transaction to incorporate usage of procedure code alongside Service type code; I developed multiple integration options and present to the business teams the pro’s con’s of each.

Honarary Secretary,
I wanted to inform about the new leakages seen in my apartment these days. This is especially noticed when its raining heavily for two days and more. 

The key damage is visible in the hall room near ceiling; the earlier seepage in hall was addressed by applying a patch on the fifth floor terrace. The cracks/ crevices appear to have widened. The rain water has been sipping over last two years. Now the ceiling is showing wet patches and ceiling colour is coming off and air pockets are developing

Another spot/ area is near the dining room where the internal stairs lead to upper floor bedrooms. There is a column and beam near that stair. At this spot, i can now see cracks getting developed and plaster is coming off the wall

Third area is on the upper sixth floor bedroom, near the terrace facing wall. The colour is peeling off and air pockets can be seen; this is also showing signs of seepage.

I believe that there is a need of water-proofing for both sixth and sevent floor terrace. Can you please arrange for a civil contractor, ask them for inspection of these leakages and take appropriate corrective actions. This repair work/ water-proofing is needed before the coming monsoon approaches.

This repair work is also blocking the re-colouring of my appartment. Its been more than ten years since the apartment was last painted. The colour has faded over the years. How can i arrange or proceed for re-painting if water-proofing is not done.
I would really like this leakage to be addressed before it gets worse.

Would appreciate a quick action from the society and from your side.
With Kind Regards,
Mrs. H. Kothare.

issues with vision started in since monday 23rd Oct. it concerning especially while driving; Its also noticable when i get up after extended sitting/ working and moving around. While doing office work at stretch, i do not notice (possibly as i do deep-dive into work)
i have been trying hard to trace how and when it started; on Sunday afternoon i went for Blue Angels show and drove back without any issues; It was from Monday morning while dropping kids to school, when i noticed odd visibility first; it is surely making me uncomfortable
Problem is like a binocular where we are unable to focus/match left and right lense.. i am literally seeing double; more prominent during day and while moving
The only observations i have:
the working pressure at both office as well as home is high as few weeks at stretch
my sleep time has dropped to 5-6 hours which is causing stress as well

UNASSERTIVE/CONFORMIST: Persons with this profile are average on adjustment, prudence, and likeability, low on sociability, and extremely low on intelligence and ambition. Described by others with terms such as agreeable, un-ambitious, and reminiscent.

 

IMPULSIVE/EXTRAVERTED: Persons with this profile are relatively assertive, uninhibited.

 

PARENT DRIVER:   This person feels like it’s their duty to correct other drivers by retaliating.

 

AGGRESSIVE DRIVER:  Due to poor time management, this person tends to speed, tailgate and cut-off other drivers.

 

INEXPERIENCED DRIVER:  This type of driver usually takes unnecessary chances and puts others at risk.

 

“I OWN THE ROAD” DRIVER:  This type of driver impedes the flow of traffic, gets angry if someone else is in their way.  

 

THE SCARED DRIVER:  Usually is over-cautious when driving.




----------------------------------


Are Men Better Drivers Than Women?:

"All the evidence points to young males having riskier driving habits than young females. Men between the ages of 16 and 25 are much more likely to be involved in accidents, or be cited for traffic violations," explains Insurance.com VP, Sam Belden. "Insurance companies bear this kind of behavior in mind when quoting rates."



-------------------------------------

Stress is a psychological response to an event or events that upsets our personal balance – stress is meant to protect us – but the more it’s activated, the harder it is to turn off.

IDT Curriculum


-------------------------------------

Once in a while, you may become so ill that you cannot operate a motor vehicle safely. If this happens to you, you must not drive. However, in case of an emergency, you may drive to the nearest place where you can safely stop.


------------------------------------

YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE – DON’T DRIVE DROWSY

 

Driver fatigue leads to more than 1,500 fatalities each year in the United States.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that each year driver fatigue results in 100,000 police-reported crashes, 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries and $12.5 billion in monetary losses. However, the full impact that sleepy drivers have is unknown because crashes caused by driver fatigue are under-reported as they often rely on a driver to self-report. 

 

Fatigue and drowsiness can impair your ability to safely operate a motor vehicle, which not only puts you and your passengers in danger, but also it places everyone else on the road with you at-risk. Florida launches campaign – You Snooze, You Lose. Don’t Drive Drowsy, to encourage drivers to take proactive steps to avoid driving drowsy. 

Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles


----------------------------------

Besides alcohol, there are many other drugs that can affect a person's ability to drive safely. These drugs can have effects like those of alcohol, or even worse. 

This is true of many prescription drugs and even many of the drugs you can buy without a prescription. Drugs taken for headaches, colds, hay fever or other allergies or those to calm nerves can make a person drowsy and affect their driving. 

Pep pills, "uppers" and diet pills can cause a person to be nervous, dizzy, and unable to concentrate and can affect his or her vision. Other prescription drugs can affect your reflexes, judgment, vision and alertness in ways similar to alcohol. 

 

If you are driving, check the label before you take a drug for warnings about its effects. If you are not sure it is safe to take the drug and drive, ask your doctor or pharmacist about any side effectsNever drink alcohol while you are taking other drugs. These drugs could multiply the effects of alcohol or have additional effects of their own. These effects not only reduce your ability to be a safe driver but could cause serious health problems, even death. Illegal and some legal drugs may affect your ability to be a safe driver. For example, studies have shown that people who use marijuana make more mistakes, have more trouble adjusting to glare, and get arrested for traffic violations more than other drivers.

Traffic Signs:

There are ten colors and nine shapes of traffic signs. Each shape and each color has an exact meaning, so you must acquaint yourself with all of them.

 

Traffic Control Signals:

Traffic signals are placed at intersections to keep traffic moving and to avoid a crash. Drivers, pedestrians, and bicycle riders must obey these signals, except when an officer is directing traffic

 

Pavement Markings: 

Lines, symbols and words are often painted on a roadway to help direct drivers and control traffic flow.  You must know what the different lines and colors mean and obey them as you would traffic signs or signals.

2012 Florida Driver's Handbook

-----------------------------------------

Fog can occur at any time. Fog on highways can 

be extremely dangerous. Fog is often unexpected, and visibility can deteriorate rapidly. You should watch for foggy conditions and be ready to reduce your speed. Do not assume that the fog will thin out after you enter it. The best advice for driving in fog is don’t. It is 

preferable that you pull off the road into a rest area or truck stop until visibility is better.

2012 Florida CDL Handbook

 

The foggiest area in the United States is Point Reyes, California. It is in the top two foggiest land areas in the world with over 200 days of fog a year.

 

If you thought all fogs were created equal think again. There’s Radiation fog, Sea fog, Ground fog, Advection fog, Steam fog (also called evaporation fog), Precipitation fog, Upslope fog, Valley fog, Ice fog, Freezing fog and Artificial fog. Don't forget Brain Fog.

Farmers Almanac

 ------------------------------------

 The first few drops of rain mean danger. Roads are most slippery just after the rain begins because oil dropped from cars has not been washed away. Slow down and plan for at least two times the normal stopping distance. In a heavy rain, your tires can ride on a thin film of water, like skis. This is called hydroplaning. When your tires are not touching the road, you 

can easily lose control and skid. Keep your tires on the road by slowing down when it rains, and by having tires with the right air pressure and good tread. Brakes often become wet after driving through deep water or driving in heavy rain. They may pull to one side or the other, or they may not hold at all. If this happens, slow down and gently push on the brake pedal until your brakes are working again.

2012 Florida Driver's Handbook

 

The most rain in the United States and the world falls at Mt. Waialeale on Kauai in Hawaii. It rained an average of 460 inches (11,684 millimetres) a year from 1931 to 1960 on the tropical island mountain. That's over 38 feet (11 metres) of rain.

--------------------------------------

Strong winds make it difficult to stay in your lane. The problem is usually worse for lighter vehicles. Don't drive alongside others if you can avoid it.

2012 Florida CDL Handbook

Vision:

People can't see as sharply at night or in dim light. Also, their eyes need time to adjust to 

seeing in dim light. Most people have noticed this when walking into a dark movie theater. 

 

Glare:

Drivers can be blinded for a short time by bright light. It takes time to recover from this 

blindness. Older drivers are especially bothered by glare. Most people have been temporarily blinded by camera flash units or by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle. It  can take several seconds to recover from glare. Even two seconds of glare blindness can be dangerous. A vehicle going 55 mph will travel more than half the distance of a football field during that time. Don't look directly at bright lights when driving. Look at the right side of the road. Watch the sidelines when someone coming toward you has very bright lights on.

POOR ROADWAY CONDITIONS ARE CAUSED BY:

 

• Poor weather

• Poorly maintained roads

• Potholes

• Gravel

• Dirt

• Soft shoulders

• Construction work

• Low water crossings

• Narrow roads

• The current administration

 -----------------------------------------


Expressway Driving: 

 

Expressways, also called interstate highways, freeways, and turnpikes are multiple-lane roads with no stop signs, traffic lights, or railroad 

crossings. For these reasons, expressways can give you a fast, safe way to get where you need to go. Pedestrians, hitchhikers, bicycles, animal-drawn vehicles or motor-driven cycles and motor scooters with 150 cubic centimeter displacement or less are not allowed on expressways

Florida Driver's Handbook

 

By analyzing traffic in the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas in 2011, the Worst U.S. Traffic City is Honolulu: Drivers waste 58 hours in traffic. Aloha dude.
Metro Magazine 

-------------------------------------------

Entering and Leaving Expressways:

 

Vehicles can enter and leave expressways only at certain points. Because expressway traffic is usually moving at or close to the maximum speed allowed, you need to know how to enter and exit safely. 

All expressway entrances have three basic parts: an entrance ramp, an acceleration lane, and a merging area. Follow these guidelines to enter an expressway safely: 

• On the entrance ramp, begin checking for an opening in traffic. Signal for your turn.

 

• As the ramp straightens into the acceleration lane, speed up. Try to adjust your speed so that you can move into the traffic when you reach the end of the acceleration lane. 

 

• Merge into traffic when you can do so safely. You must yield the right-of-way to traffic on the expressway. You cannot always count on other drivers moving over to give you room to enter, but do not stop on an acceleration lane unless traffic is too heavy and there is no space for you to enter safely.

Florida Driver's Handbook

-----------------------------------------------


Minimum Safe Following Distances:

 

Leave plenty of space between you and the vehicle ahead, including bicycles. If it stops quickly, you will need time to see the danger and stop. 

Florida Driver's Handbook

 
 -----------------------------------------------

 Adjust Space to Conditions. Don't drive alongside other vehicles. Keep a longer following distance. When you see a traffic jam ahead, slow down or stop to wait for it to clear. Try hard to anticipate stops early and slow down gradually.

Florida CDL Handbook

 

Anticipate the worst when you get into an unexpected situation. Always look for an “Out”, a place to steer toward if you get in an unexpected situation. Have a plan of action and anticipate stops and slowdowns. A good driver always acts before they have to re-act.

------------------------------------------------

Use Your Horn When Needed:

 

Your horn can let others know you're there. It can help to avoid a crash. Use your horn when needed. However, it can startle others and could be dangerous when used unnecessarily.

Florida CDL Handbook

 

Communicate Clearly:

 

A defensive driver must be sure that others don't have to think much about his intentions. Communicate your driving intentions very clearly to other drivers. Use turn signals before making a turn or changing lanes and be sure to turn it off immediately after the move has been made to demonstrate that you are not trying to pull over, turn or switch lanes again. Any time you can do something to let another driver know what you're planning to do, it makes you both safer.

-----------------------------------------------------

Always drive on the right side of a two-lane highway except when passing.

Always look ahead and behind to make sure you can pass safely. Pass on the left, unless the car ahead is about to make a left turn or is in the left turn lane on a street with more than one lane in each direction. Do not pass on the shoulder (side of the road).

Passing on the right is only legal when there are two or more lanes of traffic moving in the same direction or the vehicle you are passing is making a left turn. Pulling off the roadway to pass on the right is against the law.

Florida Driver's Manual

 

Being Passed:

• The driver of the car being passed must not increase speed until the pass is complete.

 

• Help other drivers pass you safely. Move to the right side of your lane to give them more room and a better view of the road ahead

Florida Driver's Manual

---------------------------------------------------

Remember that speed limits show the fastest speed you may drive under good conditions. You are responsible for adjusting your driving speed to the road conditions. For example, if the weather is bad or there is a lot of traffic, you must drive more slowly than the posted speed. The safe speed is the one that allows you to have complete control of your vehicle and avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. 

 

Speed limit signs are posted at the beginning of a speed zone and drivers must be driving no higher than that speed starting at the location of the posted sign and continuing until there is a posted speed limit change.  

 

Driving Too Slowly is also Against the Law:

 

Drive with the flow of traffic (within the speed limit). You should not drive so slowly that you block other vehicles moving at normal, safe speeds. 

 

When driving slower than the flow of traffic, keep right so others may safely pass. You can be issued a ticket for driving too slowly. When the posted speed limit is 70 mph, the minimum speed limit is 50 mph.

Florida Driver's Manual

-----------------------------------------------

When a car is traveling at a high speed, a driver has less time to identify hazards and react to what is happening around them. It takes vehicles further to stop from higher speeds, and if there is a crash, the injuries will be more severe.

Speed increases both the thinking distance and the braking distance. A driver traveling at faster speeds will have covered more ground in between spotting a hazard and reacting to it.

Speed limits are, therefore, set to help drivers understand the dangers of each road, and inform drivers of the legal maximum speed, above which the risks to the driver and other road users are too great to accept.

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents

-----------------------------------------------

Use  these defensive driving tips if you see that you are about to be involved in a crash: 

 

• It is better to swerve right instead of toward oncoming traffic to prevent a crash. 

 

• Hitting a row of bushes is better than hitting a tree, post or solid object. 

 

• Hitting a vehicle moving in the same direction as you are is better than hitting a vehicle head-on. 

 

• It is better to drive off the road than skid off when avoiding a crash. 

 

• It is better to hit something that is not moving instead of a vehicle moving toward you

 

2012 Florida Driver's Manual

-------------------------------------------------

OFF ROAD RECOVERY

• Grip the steering wheel tightly. 

• Take your foot off the gas pedal--do not hit the brakes suddenly or hard.

• Use the brakes carefully, and don't try to swing back onto the pavement.

• Always take the path of least resistance.

• Try to avoid any obstacles that may be in your way.

• Wait until you're speed is reduced, check the traffic behind you, and then carefully drive back onto the pavement.

 

SKIDDING: 

• Take your foot off the gas pedal. 

• Do not use your brakes, if possible. 

• Pump the brakes gently if you are about to hit something. 

• Steer the car into the direction of the skid to straighten the vehicle out. Then steer in the direction you wish to go.

Florida Driver's Manual

 

COMMON CAUSES OF SKIDS ARE:

• Water (hydroplaning)

• Ice, oil splatter

• Under-inflated tires bald or slick tires

• Abrupt weight transfer from unexpected steering inputs

• Sudden braking and cornering

------------------------------------------------

Defensive driving means doing all you can to prevent crashes. As a defensive driver, you will “give” a little. You will change your driving to fit the weather conditions, the way you feel, and the actions of other drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.  Follow these steps to avoid crashes: 

 

1.Look for possible danger. Think about what might happen. If there are children playing by the road, plan what you will do if one runs or rides into the street.

 

2.Understand what can be done to prevent a crash. 

 

3.Act in time. Once you have seen a dangerous situation, act right away to prevent a crash.

 

Use these defensive driving tips if you see that you are about to be involved in a crash:

 

• It is better to swerve right instead of toward oncoming traffic to prevent a crash. 

 

• Hitting a row of bushes is better than hitting a tree, post or solid object. 

 

• Hitting a vehicle moving in the same direction as you are is better than hitting a vehicle head-on. 

 

• It is better to drive off the road than skid off when avoiding a crash. 

 

• It is better to hit something that is not moving instead of a vehicle moving toward you.

-------------------------------------------

Avoiding rear-end Collisions:

 

Many crashes happen because one vehicle runs into the back of another one. Here are some things you can do to lower the risk of someone 

running into the rear of your vehicle.

 

• Check your brake lights often to make sure they are clean and working properly

 

• Know what is going on around you. Use your rearview mirrors

 

• Signal well in advance for turns, stops and lane changes

 

• Slow down gradually. Avoid any sudden actions

 

• Drive with the flow of traffic (within the speed limit). Driving too slowly can be as dangerous as driving too fast

 

• To avoid striking the vehicle in the front of you, keep at least two seconds following distance.  This is accomplished by using the two second rule. Information for the two-second rule is found under the section, Minimum Safe Following Distances

Knowing the safety features your car has can help you save your life.

------------------------------------------------

What if the car were to go under the water, or catch on fire? 

There is less than 1% of car crashes that involve fire or submersion. Even then, being secured by seat belts, you have a better chance of survival because the belt would hold you upright in the seat. You would be less likely to be knocked unconscious during a tertiary or third collision.

A majority of people who have died in automobile collisions while not wearing seat belts steamed from the fact that they “Just never got in the habit”.

The habit takes only 3 seconds to fasten a seat belt. Spending 3 seconds to buckle up will increase your chances of survival. You would be safer by staying inside the car. You have had a much better chance of getting out if you are conscious. Hoping to get thrown clear of a car by not wearing seat belts is asking for trouble.

Even a short trip at slow speeds seat belts should still be worn.

 

Most injuries or deaths occurred within 25 miles of home and at speeds between 30 to 45 miles per hour.

Life has been lost in crashes as low as 10 miles per hour where seat belts weren’t worn.

Many lives have been saved in crashes up to 60 miles per hour when seat belts were worn.

------------------------------------------------

Wear a lap belt around your hips, not your stomach. Fasten the belt snugly. Wear a shoulder belt only with a lap belt. Don’t just use your safety belt for long trips or high-speed highways. More than half of the crashes that cause injury or death happen at speeds less than 40 MPH and within 25 miles from home.

Florida Driver's Manual

 

The driver and front seat passengers must wear seat belts. The seat belt law applies to passenger cars manufactured beginning with the 1968 model year, and trucks beginning with the 1972 model year.  It is unlawful for any person to operate a vehicle in this state unless every passenger of the vehicle under the age of 18 is restrained by a safety belt or by a child restraint device, regardless of seating position.  
A seat belt violation will be charged to the driver when a person under 18 is not restrained by a safety belt or a child restraint device. If the passenger is 18 years of age or older and fails to wear a seat belt when required by law, the passenger will be charged with the violation.

Three Crashes in Three Years Law: 

 

Effective January 1, 2010, section 322.0261(1)(c) requires that if you were convicted of or pleaded nolo contender to your third traffic offense that caused a crash within 36 months, you must complete a department approved driver improvement course that includes behind-the-wheel training and an assessment of your driving safety. The department notifies you of this requirement based on a qualifying third at fault crash occurring on or after January 1, 2010.

What you must do to avoid driver license cancellation: 

 

• Complete 12 hours of the 3-in-3 Crash Course or an approved advanced driver improvement course (ADI)

 

• Receive 4-hours of behind-the-wheel training from a Florida licensed commercial driving school (CDS)

 

• Pass the extended road test with a DL examiner or Tax Collector licensing agent

 

• Failure to complete these requirements within 90 days will result in a license cancellation

Pedestrians and drivers must yield the right-of-way to law enforcement vehicles, fire engines and other emergency vehicles using sirens and/ or flashing lights. Pull over to the closest edge of the roadway immediately and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. Do not block intersections. 

Florida Driver's Manual

 ------------------------------------------

Following Officer’s and Fireman’s Instructions

If you are stopped by a law enforcement officer, pull off immediately to the extreme right, clear of traffic when possible. 

 

• Turn off your engine. 

 

• Reduce your headlights to the parking light position at night. Sit calmly and follow the instructions of the officer. You must follow any lawful order or direction of (1) any law enforcement officer or (2) any fireman at the scene of a fire who is directing traffic. 

 

• If a law enforcement officer is directing traffic where there are signal lights, obey the officer - not the signals.

In Florida, there are two motor vehicle insurance laws. They are the Financial Responsibility Law and the No-Fault law. It is important that you understand these laws because if you do not have the proper insurance, you can lose your driver license and license plate(s) and have to pay large fees to get them back.

Florida Driver's Manual

 

ACTUAL INSURANCE STATEMENT CLAIMS

 

• Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have

• The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intention 

• I thought my window was down, but I found it was up when I put my head through it 

• I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way 

• A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face 

• The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him 

• I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed over the embankment

License suspension and Revocation

Driving a Motor Vehicle in Florida is a Privilege You Earn.

Every driver who obtains a license must drive safely to keep it. If you break the traffic laws or become an unsafe driver, your license can be taken away. It can be suspended, revoked, or canceled. 

 

Suspension: The temporary withdrawal of a licensee's privilege to drive a motor vehicle.

 

Revocation: The termination of a licensee's privilege to drive a motor vehicle.

 

Cancellation: The act of declaring a driver's license void and terminated.

 

Florida Driver's Manual

 

Purchase a driving record to find out how many points are on your Florida record. The record clearly indicates the points with details of the tickets, when the citations were issued, and where. Sanctions are based on specific number of points within a 12 month, 24 month or a 36 month period.

If I get a ticket in another state that earns points in Florida, You will I receive points on your Florida Driving record. For example, if you get a speeding ticket for going 14 miles above the speed limit outside Florida, you will earn 3 points on your Florida record. It does not matter how many points the other states would assess against their drivers-Florida treats this as though the ticket was received in Florida.

Florida drivers are not eligible to attend driving school on out-of-state tickets.

Keeping your car in good condition: 

 

No matter how well you drive, you are not safe unless your vehicle is in good condition. If it is not, you could have a serious crash.

Florida Driver's Handbook

----------------------------------------

Almost two-thirds of car owners put off automotive maintenance, increasing the chances they will have mechanical breakdowns on the road.

Here's what the automotive repair website says are the most common car problems, according to its database, which uses engine electronic diagnostic reports and other measures to track vehicle failures and repairs.

 

• Replace oxygen sensor

 

• Check gas cap:

 

• Replace catalytic converter

 

• Replace mass air flow sensor

 

• Replace spark plug

 --------------------------------------------

How long can they go?

The greatest factor in tire longevity is the roads on which you drive.
The next factor is how you drive.

Next is the type of tires you have.

----------------------------------------------

"Max Load/Max Pressure" is not the pressure at which the tire will burst. Instead, increasing pressure beyond this point results in no additional load-carrying capacity beyond that stated.

 

Your tires should have visible tread of at least 2/32 of an inch across the base with no worn spots showing the ply. Smooth tires on wet roads contribute to thousands of serious crashes. 

-------------------------------------------

Check to see that the pedal stays well above the floor when you step on it. If the car pulls to one side when you use the brakes or you hear any scraping or squealing noises, your brakes may need to be repaired.

 

• Pump the brake pedal hard and fast, except for vehicles with anti-lock brakes. 

 

• Shift to a lower gear. 

 

• Apply the parking brake slowly and make sure that you are holding down the release lever or button. This will prevent your rear wheels from locking and your vehicle from skidding. 

 

• Rub your tires on the curb to slow your vehicle, or pull off the road into an open space.

 -----------------------------------------

 Causes of Power Steering Failure:

 

• Contamination

 

• Low fluid

 

• Snapped belt

 

• Worn pump

 

• Leaks
-------------------------------

Replace burned-out bulbs and clean lenses often. Dirty headlights can cut your night vision by one-half.  

 

Burned out signal lights or brake lights mean you can’t tell other drivers what you are doing. Keep your lights adjusted so that you don’t blind oncoming drivers. 

 

Parking lights must be used at night on any vehicle parked on a roadway or shoulder outside of cities and towns. Driving with parking lights only (in place of headlights) is against the law.

Florida Driver's Handbook

------------------------------------

Anti-Locking Brake System (ABS):

 

Anti-lock brakes prevent skidding and allow drivers to steer during an emergency braking situation. ABS can help improve vehicle stability (avoiding spin-outs), steering ability (directing the car where the driver wants it to go) and stopping capability (distance needed to stop the vehicle).

 

Drivers can determine whether their cars have ABS by looking for a lighted ABS symbol on the dashboard right after starting the engine, checking the owner's manual or asking the dealer.

Florida Driver's Handbook

---------------------------------

Following a Truck:

 

• In general, trucks take slightly longer than cars to stop because of their size. However, at highway speeds or on wet roads, trucks may have better traction and stability allowing them to stop more quickly. A car following too closely may not be able to stop quickly enough to avoid rear-ending the truck.

 

• If you are following a truck, stay out of its “blind spot” to the rear. Avoid following too closely and position your vehicle so the truck driver can  you in his side mirrors. Then you will have a good view of the road ahead, and the truck driver can give you plenty of warning for a stop or a turn. You will have more time to react and make a safe stop. 

 

• When you follow a truck at night, always dim your headlights. Bright lights from a vehicle behind will blind the truck driver when they reflect off the truck’s large side mirrors. 

 

• If you are stopped behind a truck on an upgrade, leave space in case the e truck drifts back slightly when it starts to move. Also, keep to the left in your lane so the driver can see that you’re stopped behind the truck.

------------------------------------

On a two way street or highway, all drivers moving in either direction must stop for a stopped school bus  which is picking up or dropping off children. You must remain stopped until all children are clear of the roadway and the bus’ stop arm is withdrawn. 

 

If the highway is divided by a raised barrier or an unpaved median at least five feet wide, you do not have to stop if you are moving in the opposite direction of the bus. Painted lines or pavement markings are not considered barriers. You must always stop if you are moving in the same direction as the bus and you must remain stopped until the bus stop arm is withdrawn

Florida Driver's Handbook

------------------------------------

Motorcycle Awareness: 

 

According to the Hurt Study (the most comprehensive motorcycle safety study to date), “The failure of motorists to detect and recognize 

motorcycles in traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents.

 

A few key trends : 

 

1. Motorcycles are More Mainstream.  Since 2003, the number of motorcycles owned and used in America grew 19 percent.  Continuing a trend, that was a 58 percent increase since 1998. 

 

2. Motorcyclists Make More Money.  While owning a motorcycle is much more affordable in many ways compared to having a car, the median household income of motorcycle owners exceeds that of the average American.  Two-wheel households average $59,290 while the 

U.S. average is $50,233. 

 

3. You Go Girl! Female ownership of motorcycles crossed the 10-percent mark, increasing from 9.6 percent in 2003 up to 12.3 percent in 2008. 

 

4. A New Generation is Riding.   In 2003, Baby Boomer riders outnumbered Gen Y motorcyclists almost four to one.  But Gen Y motorcycle ownership grew 62 percent since 2003, putting the current ratio of Baby Boomers to Gen Y at two to one.

--------------------------------------

There is no federal law in the U.S. requiring bicycle helmets.  

 

At present, 22 States including the District of Columbia have state-wide laws, and more than 201 localities have local ordinances.

 

Florida riders Under 16 must wear a helmet unless on private property.

-------------------------------------

Solving the Epidemic of Preventable Pedestrian Deaths:

 

Between 2000 and 2009, 5,163 people were killed while walking in Florida, which cost the state $22.20 billion. Reducing pedestrian fatalities just 10% would have saved Florida $2.22 billion over 10 years. Florida's overall Pedestrian Danger Index (PDI) is 182.8, which ranks1st out of 50 states.

------------------------------------------

In Florida, during 2011, there were 52 highway‐railroad grade crossing incidents that resulted in 7 fatalities. Florida now ranks fifth in the nation in grade crossing fatalities. During 2011, there were 43 trespasser incidents and 26 fatalities. Florida ranks fourth in the nation in trespass fatalities. These incidents could have been prevented.

 

About Operation Lifesaver:

 

Operation Lifesaver’s mission is to end collisions, deaths and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and on rail property through a nationwide network of volunteers who work to educate people about rail safety. Our national office in Alexandria, VA, supports state programs, developing videos, educational brochures, instructional information and other materials for audiences of all ages. Our state coordinators are located in all 50 states.

--------------------------------------------

Drinking and Driving:

 

If you drink alcohol, even a little, your chances of being in a crash is much greater than if you did not drink any alcohol. No one can drink alcohol and drive safely, even if you have been driving for many years. Young drivers are more affected by alcohol because their bodies are still in the growth process and their livers have not developed to the extent that they can efficiently process the alcohol in their blood stream. 

Florida Driver's Handbook

 -------------------------------------------

 Common slang for being inebriated:

 

Blasted, clobbered, destroyed, hammered, juiced, obliterated, pickled,  pie-eyed, pissed, polluted, ripped, shickered, snockered, stinko, swacked, three-sheets-to-the-wind and zonked. 

And yes, there are many more.

------------------------------------------

Drinking affects a motorist’s thinking and slows reaction time. Alcohol may also give a motorist a false feeling that he/she can do anything. 

Law enforcement is trained to notice certain telltale signs that a motorist has been drinking: 

 

• Speeding: An intoxicated driver often thinks high speed driving is safe.

 

• Weaving: Even though an intoxicated driver may stay in the correct lane, driving straight may be a problem.

 

• Slow driving: An intoxicated driver may be overly cautious and drive slower than the normal traffic flow.

 

• Jerking motion: An intoxicated driver often may have short mental lapses and not keep a steady speed on a clear road.

 

• Quick stops: An intoxicated driver may make sudden stops at a traffic sign or light, rather than easing up to it.

-----------------------------------------------

• Alcohol should never be mixed with any drugs or medications.

 

• If asked, motorists using prescription drugs must show proof of the prescription to law enforcement. If a motorist does not have a prescription for the drug, and a prescription is necessary in order to obtain the drug, the drug will be considered illegal. After alcohol, marijuana is the drug most often found with drivers involved in collisions. Marijuana use may affect a motorist in the following ways: 

 

• Loss of tracking ability: This is the ability to maintain a vehicle in a given line. 

 

• Distance judgment: Following too closely can cause problems.

 

• Vigilance: Not remaining attentive to the driving task can cause a motorist to follow too closely, drift into another lane, etc.

 

• Divided attention: Driving is a task that requires constant attention to traffic, roadway and weather conditions, passengers, gauges, etc.

-------------------------------------------

Because drinking alcohol and then driving is so dangerous, the penalties are very tough. People who drive after drinking risk heavy fines, higher insurance rates, loss of license and even jail sentences. A DUI conviction will remain on your driving record for 75 years.

Florida Driver's Handbook

 --------------------------------------

 All states have ‘implied consent laws’ that come into effect when you are tested for BAC if it is over .08 percent or if you refuse to take a chemical test for BAC when requested by a police officer. In some states you may even find this information in the fine print on your driver’s license. The laws you are subjected to are those of the state in which you were arrested, not the state where you obtained your driver’s license.

 

You will be asked to take a blood test, a urine test, or a breath test if an officer thinks that you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs while driving. By law, if you drive in Florida, you have agreed by signing your driver license to take these tests if asked. If you refuse to take the tests when asked, your license will automatically be suspended for one year.  A second refusal will result in an 18 month suspension and is a second degree misdemeanor.

Florida Driver's Handbook

-----------------------------------

By creating the  Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk  campaign, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Ad Council launched an effort that would change the way Americans think about drinking and driving. Eighty-four percent of Americans recall having seen or heard a d”Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk”  public service announcement. Nearly 80 percent report they took action to prevent a friend or loved one from driving drunk, and 25 percent report they stopped drinking and driving as a result of the campaign.

 

The  “Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk”  campaign has taken many forms. Most recently, the "Innocent Victims" phase of PSAs features victims of drunk driving crashes. The message is clear: drunk driving is a deadly act that ends thousands of lives each year.

------------------------------

Yield signs directly relate to the "right of way" laws. Right of way laws are generally misunderstood by the average driver. Technically, the right of way is granted to no one.

 

The law only states who must yield the right of way and in what instances it must be yielded. As such, a yield sign is a direction to the driver that he or she must yield the right of way to other drivers.

 

Applying simple driver courtesy can provide a much more relaxed commute and also serves to ease the flow of traffic by reducing the number of conflicts and collisions. Keep a good attitude while operating a motor vehicle.

---------------------------------

Studies have shown that kids drive like their parents. If you speed (even a little), forget to wear a seatbelt (even once or twice), or drive with distractions (even on rare occasions), it can set a bad example.

Show your kids that you know how to be a safe driver. Know that they are watching you and learning from you at every minute, and always drive as you hope they will drive.

Hi Dave,
Today was my recouping day, trying to catchup with pending sleep.
Now that i am fresh again, i wanted to reach out to once again convey my thanks for the amazing opportunity at ISSDC. it was a memorable experience. It had a life learning as well from Sanday Night in Vulture Aviation!!. I believe i got a glimpse into how a large organization like NASA work. As an after thought, i would love to hear from you any feedback about me or my work and how I can improve myself going forward.
i am sure we will interact again as i will be participating in Team Resistance this year as well.
