Work quality is the value of work delivered by an individual, team or organization. This can include the quality of task completion, interactions and deliverables. Work quality is a common consideration in managing the performance of programs, projects, vendors and individuals. The following are common types of work quality.

 * Fit For Purpose -- Work products that are fit for purpose, meaning that they achieve objectives efficiently.
 * Conformance to Requirements -- Required features and functions are delivered to requirements and non-functional requirements
 * Completeness -- Work is complete with nothing missing.
 * Correctness -- Work that is free of bugs and errors.
 * Accurate -- Work is accurate and credible.
 * Diligence -- Work is prepared with careful and persistent effort. For example, documents that are well researched.
 * Professional -- Consistency with the norms and practices of a profession. For example, a lawyer who uses legal terms accurately.
 * Communication -- The quality of communication such as presentations and documentation.
 * Compliance -- Compliance with regulations and standards.
 * Controls -- Work conforms to the internal controls of an organization such as a project that follows proper financial controls in managing budget.
 * Best Practices -- Work conforms to the practices of an industry or profession. For example, a document that would be held in high regard if it were reviewed by peers.
 * Risk -- Reasonable efforts were made to identify and manage risk. For example, a construction job that is conducted safely.
 * Integration -- Work that is well integrated with other elements of the business such as business processes.
 * Usability -- Delivered work is comprehensible and usable.

Hi Sarah,

Now that we have the extensions in hand, we wanted to have stamping done.
We know this is not technically required as we can stay inside US till 2026 Feb.
Here is the main reason: our parents are aging now, they are approaching 80 and need our visits at a very short notice. 
Also as the election year is round the corner, the uncertainties still persist.
I needed some advice from you and Jeniffer as i start working on DS-160.
Is it advisable for me to visit Mexico-City or Bahama or any city in Canada to get my Visa stamped? or is it still preferable to visit Australia (Sydney) for the same?
One more question as i start my DS 160: last time i visited Perth, Australia in 2020, my case went into Administrative processing as my LCA was not signed by Synergy. Will that have any bearing during this visit? or do i need to mention anything to this effect in my DS 160 application?
As i plan my visit, i am only travelling alone and have Prajakta and kids stay in Florida. They can visit India once they get school-break.
Also are there any specific documents that i will need to arrange for the Stamping?
Anxiously awaiting your response.
With Warm Regards,
-Amit


Hi Ravindra, Sri

Now that i have the extensions available, i wanted to make a quick Visa Stamping trip
Though the stamping is not essential, i need to make this provision for family.
Both Prajakta and my parents are getting older and they ask for our presence/ visit suddenly. Without the Visa stamped, it will put us in bad situation. 
From Synergy, i will need the LCA document signed -- note that in 2020 the Consulate office caught just that and put it in Administrative processing.
I am trying to see if i can take chance and visit Mexico or Bahama. Else i will need to travel all the way to Sydney Australia. 
Also importantly i will like to make provision for the days that will take off... Can we arrange to take off certain amount from my salary in coming cycles and use it later.. so that my payroll can be run even for the days that i visit US Consulate. I will try to reach out to you tomorrow and talk about it.
With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi Beata,

As we prepare to submit the extension for my visa, just wanted to confirm if this will be for all in family, Me, wife and both boys; We also have the EAD for my wife which will need extention too. Or will it be only my extension first and them followed by theirs? In either case do let me know if i need to give you any of their documentation.. i believe you may be having the visa copies for all of us. Also as Prajakta missed our event last week, i will appreciate if you can give her a quick call at "786-340-5952" so she can clarify her doubts too.
After learning the hurdles that are coming forth these days, we are arranging to have both of our Education certifcates and marksheets evaluated for US equivalent ones.
I believe we will also have to arrange for the fees for my family.



With Warm Regards,
-Amit


Hi Beata,

A quick update.. we received the acknowledgement from USCIS yesterday for the address change we did on the application of Prajakta and boys
I just wanted to check if i need to update address on my application too. As per the receipt the address seems to be of Synergy / youor office -- i believe i should be good.
Do let me know if anything is needed from my side.


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Thanks a million

Hi Jeniffer/ Beata,
i got the happy-text from Raj and Sri in the afternoon. It was a very big relief for me -- took away my tension in a moment.
Got to appreciate and thank all of you for supporting me during this extension process..

in my next 2-yearly-process i will be better prepared :)

As you had righly indicated both me and Prajakta, hear-say and info coming from social groups (facebook, whatsapp, twitter) only cause us more tensions..
Being the person i am, even for the projects i deliver at work, i always have contingency plan-a, plan-b, plan-c for each of my critical applications.. naturally for my visa-work, i was constantly on look-out for possible scenarios un-folding and corresponding action plans !!


Sincere thanks once again.
With Warm Regards,

Hi Jeniffer/ Beata,

this one is a low priority discussion i will like to start with you.

Now that we have the extension approved, what are the next steps.
 * i beleive the original documents from USCIS will arrive at your office?
 * guess we will receive in post the copy of those, similar to the visa extensions we did for Prajakta and Kids end of last year.
 * so also this extension implies that we can stay legally here till 2020 may.
 * now is the tricky point.. Prajakta needs to visit india to complete few of her financial activities, which are long pending.
 * also either of me or Prajakta will need to visit Sydney and check our property there.. before the end of the year..
 * do we only need to carry this extension document with us each time we make trips out of US?
 * or will we need any other procedures, like stamping to be done
 * the very first use of the extension document will be when we do our drivers license renewals next month
 * one more topic was around our passports which expire next year.. we will be working with Australian consulate office for that one.
 * yet another topic was i-140 .. and how that one works
 * believe now that we applied for i-140, do we get from that department any case number or do we need to wait for some date when the department acknowledges the receipt of our application?

Wishing you all a very happy long weekend. we can catch-up sometime next week and have a chat.


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi Rajesh/ Sri,
Dropping a quick email.. i will need to make a short trip to australia to meet the estate agent managing my home there... I will to make the trip in early January -- From Florida Blue perspective, my key projects will not be having demanding needs that time.. Can you please help arrange for my visa stamping and E3 extension with Beata? As usual i will need a new LCA and Florida Blue letter (with project end dates on it) .. Also, can Beata/ or the firm, create/ file the DS160 application for me (for the Sydney office??) that will be very helpful... As Sydney appointments take 2 months or so, i am starting the coversation now itself.

I know Beata/ Jeniffer are against consultant traveling outside the country.. but this cannot be avoided each time. 

Only other options i can think about is to make a stamping trip to Mexico now in Oct/ Nov. And once i have the new stampped E3 visa on passport, then travel to Australia matching the availibility of my estate agent and rental-tenant.


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi Beata,

As in indicated in my email to Sri before, i have a current travel requirement to visit realtor in sydney for my property; Also my next travel need is the india trip in coming summer vacation for thread-ceremony for both of my boys.

Looking at long term -- last time we had to do the extension, so on the same visa-on-passport that expired in 2018, we filed the extension. Now that i am travelling, should we not arrange for visa renewal rather than continuing on the visa-extension. I understood that the extension is given by USCIS only as a provision for those who have hurdles in travelling out; they can always question "was the project so critical that i was not able to find any two week window to travel for proper visa renewal uptill now?"

Right now i am not in such a critical project. Also my managers are good for me to go on a short vacation for visa stamping. i believe we can file a new LCA when less than 6 months are left for the extension expiry date. Now should be the right time to arrange and apply for visa renewal rather than waiting for yet another extension. Also in order to file for renewal we will need new LCA, and new client letter indicating the duration of project (like last time, the soc-code will need to match); The very purpose of the E3 visa is for easier processing, rather than having such constraints each time you have to travel; Doing just the extensions does cause inconvinience, as we need to visit our families in US and Canada.

In either ways, for meeeting my real-estate agent in sydney, i do need to travel as early i can; so i will get started with my DS 160 application and will get inputs from you where i get stuck in filling the form. Also please let me know your convinient times: possibly me, Sri and you can have a quick / short conference call and talk;


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi Sri/ Beata,
Now that i have the visa stamped; can we please have the extensions for Prajakta and Kids arranged? we were planning for their stamping trip.. but now with the global travel uncertainties around the Virus, i believe doing the extension is our only option.

Beata, please send me the link to upload the relevant documents. Also let me know the fees so that i can arrange for the same. It will be E3D visa extenstion for three (Prajakta, Dhanesh and Yuvan); and also EAD extension for Prajakta.


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi Beata,
Reaching out to you after long. As you can guess, my E3 visa renewal time is approaching.
Like each time, i am trying to notify a few months before hand so that any prep-work can be initiated and we can put the application in a timely manner. 

My current E3 visa expiry date is Feb-28-2022 (5 months remaining)
this time i want to make the application from US (without travelling outside country)
Australia has high travel restrictions with pandemic
I also wanted to mention and ask if we can apply for my renewal as well as for all of my dependents at same time
Last time, the dependant visas and EAD for my wife took more than 13-14 months

Also i believe that for my category we are now eligible for premium application


With Warm Regards,
-Amit

Hi All,
I am dropping an email to all of us after a while
Time flies quite fast these days; i am approaching another Visa renewal soon
My current visa is valid upto Feb 28th 2024; we are still four months away.
But we keep hearing in news, that the government departments are have partial shutdowns 
and new policies keep taking effect from time to time;

I wanted to get in touch with you all and find if we need to initiate my Visa renewal process from now itself? 
in case if any action is needed on preparing for LCA renewal, updating job profile or collecting documents etc, do let me know.


Also, can this renewal be done as an express processing, paying higher fees?
i believe we had done that for my applciation last time 
And dependent's applications were sent as normal processing



With Warm Regards,
-Amit
