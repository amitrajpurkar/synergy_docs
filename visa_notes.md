questions... from i765 questionnaire for EAD renewal
page i765 Application and Eligibility Category information: here first item is correct, applying for "renewal of my permission to accept employment". For item-two, "Eligibility Category", my category E3D or E3S is not available in the list; From the list the closest match is "spouse of E-1/E-2 treaty visa" it does not mention E3 visa anywhere; should i select spouse of H1B or E1/E2 here? or leave it blank?
page Content of Disclosure; here i have selected Yes to authorize SSA; but question i got is SSA does not need to issue me another SSN card or number (as indicated by the question) 
page Additional Citizenship information: here the answer is still Australia as we are no longer Indian Citizens; Indian citizenship was revoked when we accepted Australian citizenship
page c3C Eligibility Category-I: here only one option was available; i have entered the Masters degree information; there are many more degrees that i have
page c3C Eligibility Category-II: here my company or profession does on appear on the provided list. so i have given the employer-name "ESS" (https://ess.com) and mentioned that i am working as a Substitute Teacher
page E Verify Company ID: i do not have this information with me
page c-26 Eligibility Category: Do i keep this answer as None? or provide Amit's receipt number for 2022 approval notice of i797 Visa Extension??
page c35 & c36 Eligibility Category -I: here again should this be left blank as the primary applicants extension is being filed same time? or should i enter receipt number from the 2022 visa extension approval (i787) which is EAC2205351636; another confusion was that this question also talks about i140 as well as i797

## notes for Bahamas, nasau
 * Neither possession of a previous visa nor application for a visa serves as a guarantee that the applicant will be issued a new visa. The consul will consider each application on its own merits at the time of the interview.
 * Applicants must upload a photo to complete the DS-160. If your photo does not properly upload the first time, most likely the file size is too big. Please reduce the size of the file and try again. If you are still unable to upload your preferred photo, please upload any photo and bring the desired photograph with you to the Embassy at the time of your interview.
 * After completing the DS-160, you must schedule your interview. Information about scheduling your interview can be found on the Embassy Nassau website.
 * Applicants age 14+ must appear in person for the interview and may not bring their own translators or other individuals to assist in the interview process.
 * Information about applying for a visa for an individual age 13 years or younger can be found on our website (http://nassau.usembassy.gov/childrenvisa.html)
 * Applicants must bring all required documents to the interview. Applicants possessing valid or expired visas are advised to bring them to the interview for review.
